            "Whether you call it collage, compilation, found footage, d\u00e9tournement, or recycled cinema, the incorporation of already existing media into new artworks is a practice that generates novel juxtapositions and new meanings and ideas, often in ways entirely unrelated to the intentions of the original makers. Such new works are, in other words, \u201cinappropriate.\u201d This act of (in)appropriation may even produce revelations about the relationship between past and present, here and there, intention and subversion, artist and critic, not to mention the \"producer\" and \"consumer\" of visual culture itself. Fortunately for our purposes, the past decade has witnessed the emergence of a wealth of new audiovisual elements available for appropriation into new works. In addition to official state and commercial archives, resources like vernacular collections, home movie repositories, and digital archives now also provide fascinating material to repurpose in ways that lend it new meaning and resonance.Founded in 2009, the Festival of (In)appropriation is a yearly showcase of contemporary, short (20 minutes or less), audiovisual works that appropriate existing film, video, or other media and repurpose it in \u201cinappropriate\u201d and inventive ways. The show is curated by Jaimie Baron, Lauren Berliner, and Greg Cohen.Astro Black: We are the Robots by Soda_Jerk(Australia, digital video, color, sound, 2010, 6:35)",
            "The Festival of (In)appropriation is pleased to return to the provocative Afrofuturist musings of Astro Black, the on-going video cycle by Australian duo Soda_Jerk. In episode 2, We are the Robots, the artists sound the impact of German electronic music on Afrofuturist sonic culture, by re-imagining the iconic scene in Close Encounters of the Third Kind in which scientists communicate with an alien mothership via keyboard synthesizer. In Soda_Jerk's speculative revision, Kraftwerk play sequences from their own music and the mothership responds with fragments of tracks that have sampled Kraftwerk. As with all the episodes of Astro Black, cosmic jazz man Sun Ra also makes the scene in We are the Robots (joined this time by the likes of David Bowie, Dr. Spock, Dr. No, and Lieutenant Ohuru). The whole jam points towards a transnational conception of cultural production that unsettles our linear conceptions of time.Landscape with broken dog by Orazio Leogrande(Argentina, digital video, black & white and color, 2014, 14:00)",
            "Buenos Aires-based Italian filmmaker Orazio Leogrande's film, Landscape with Broken Dog (Paisaje con perro roto) is a cogent reflection on the common historical, technological, and ideological origins of arctic exploration, modern medicine, and the medium of cinema itself. Combining its mesmerizing original score with an incisive, heterogeneous selection of found footage culled from film archives around the world, Leogrande\u2019s work plumbs the darkest regions of a shared, often illusionary (if not delusional), positivist-imperialist dream, one that has generated so many ill-fated voyages of discovery and gruesome medical experiments, not to mention a vital archive of cinematic imagery with which to visualize and rationalize it all.Let Me ASMR You by Clint Enns(Canada, digital video, color, sound, 2014, 2:40)",
            "Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a perceptual phenomenon characterized by a tingling sensation in the head, scalp, back, or peripheral regions of the body in response to visual, auditory, or other stimuli. While there is no scientific evidence explaining ASMR, many people have reported experiencing these sensations, and many videos have been produced and posted on YouTube intended to induce an ASMR response. In this film, Enns appropriates some of these ASMR videos to create a piece of visual music, which \u2013 at least for some viewers \u2013 may have intense effects on the entire body.It Takes All Sorts by Rachel Stuckey(US, digital video, color, sound, 2014, 10:30)",
            "In It Takes All Sorts, Rachel Stuckey animates the woods and native flora so that they appear to speak excerpts from a 1970s educational film about hospital labor. In a world seemingly devoid of humans, we are left to consider the management of our biology through the healthcare system. Syncopated rhythm in sound and edit amplify and encourage a reinterpretation of care and its representation through cinema as mechanized, routine, and overproduced.Overpass by Kami Chisholm(Canada, digital video, color, sound, 2014, 4:57)",
            "In Overpass, Kami Chisolm takes us with her onto the LA freeway during the infamous OJ Simpson car chase of 1994. As we follow the pursuit of Simpson\u2019s Bronco through television news footage, Chisolm reflects, in haunting voiceover, on her own position on that same road. Weaving personal memory with the story of Shakespeare\u2019s Othello, she contemplates how each of their directions is informed by legacies of racial and domestic violence. Setting the intimate, interpersonal violence of US American life against racialized celebrity spectacle, Chisolm pursues the connection between the two as the police descend on Simpson.The End of an Error by Peter Freund(US, digital video, black & white, sound, 2013, 10:00)",
            "The 1954 Army-McCarthy Hearings marked the unmistakable beginning of the end of the \u201cRed Scare\u201d period in the United States. Sixty years hence, The End of an Error refashions the archival record to report the demise of the \u201ccommunist threat\u201d from the vantage point of what has since emerged in the American imagination as the \u201cterrorist state.\u201d The narration (in Farsi with English subtitles) relays an intricate and sometimes humorous examination of shifting political phantasms and the status of the image as historical document.Dear Britney by Battersby and Duke(US, digital video, color, sound, 2014, 5:00)",
            "In Dear Britney, we enter the mind of Britney Spears fan Gary through a heartfelt fan letter that scrolls over a remix of her career of music videos. As Gary attempts to illustrate his connection to Britney through their shared experience with mental illness, he poignantly demonstrates the disparity between his lived reality and hers. His words pass ephemerally on the screen as Britney remains a spectacle, disavowing the opportunity for mutual empathy that Gary seeks while creating a cacophony out of his fandom and personal struggle. Inspired by Mike Hoolboom\u2019s music video remake, Dear Madonna (1996).The Plastic Garden by Ip Yuk Yiu(Hong Kong, digital video, color, sound, 2013, 11:30)",
            "The Plastic Garden restages mid-century fears of nuclear apocalypse with appropriated images from the popular video game Call Of Duty: Black Ops (2010). Dreadfully quiet and serene, the film forces a confrontation between the violence of a forgotten future and our contemporary socio-political reality.Soft Pong Inari\u2028 by Michael Lyons & Palle Dahlstedt(Japan/Sweden, digital video, color, sound, 2014, 2:06)",
            "A visual experiment in crowd-sourcing, Soft Pong Inari was made entirely from pre-existing photographs of Fushimi Inari Shrine (in Kyoto, Japan) available for modified re-use in the creative commons. Michael Lyons\u2019s pulsating, recombined swarm of still images exploits the reiteration of motifs and colors across an array of anonymous sources, while Swedish composer Palle Dahlstedt\u2019s original score\u2014part dirge, part minimalist electronic landscape\u2014provides a counterpoint in slowness and simplicity to the frenetic visual track. What emerges, paradoxically, is a concrete, overarching sense of place, even as we find it impossible to fix any single image with our gaze.Notes For A Polish Jew by Abraham Ravett(US, 16mm & 8mm on digital video, color, silent, 2012, 8:05)",
            "Filmmaker Abraham Ravett was born in Poland but left as a very small child. When a colleague traveled to Lodz, Poland in the 1980s, Ravett asked him to shoot a roll of double-8 film of the city. Ravett then reworked this footage, collaging directly onto the filmstrip and optically printing his transformations. In the resulting film, Notes for a Polish Jew, Ravett envisions his father \u2013 who last saw his family in Lodz in 1944 and who passed away in 1979 at the age of 74 \u2013 visiting the city again. Imagining how his father might have filmed his return to Lodz, Ravett considers his own family history in relation to notions of Polishness, Jewishness, and their potentially fraught intersection.Send Me a Copy by Albert Alcoz(Spain, digital video, color, sound, 2011, 5:24)",
            "Send Me A Copy appropriates footage from the 1967 science fiction film A Journey To The Center Of Time, in which time-traveling scientists become lost in time. When they finally return to their temporal home, they find copies of themselves in their place. Interlacing video is a technique for doubling the amount of perceived video information without consuming extra bandwidth. The interlaced signal contains two fields of a video frame \u2013 each consisting of every other horizontal line \u2013 captured at two different times, which alternate so quickly that the viewer does not miss any information. However, when interlaced video is transferred from one format to another, the interlacing may become visible so that the two fields interfere with one another. Like the time-traveling scientists in A Journey to the Center of Time, the image becomes out of synch with itself. In Send Me A Copy, footage from the film is transformed through its interlaced images, gesturing towards the way in which video remains a form of science fiction.In Light, In! by Ken Paul Rosenthal(US, 16mm on digital video, black & white, sound, 2013, 12:00)",
            "Masterfully re-mixing recycled 16mm 1950s-era educational films, In Light, In! orchestrates a haunting and seductive visual essay in which the attempt to manage emotion is reinterpreted as both a catalyst and mirror for cultural struggle and distress. Accompanied by original musical compositions by cellist Zoe Keating."

            "Through a series of 'moving stills', accompanied by a live original soundtrack and field \u00a0recordings, Silver Ochre illustrates the immense cultural variety of early 21st century America captured by two perpetually traveling artists. Their intention is to wake up each day to experience this country as it is in this moment in time. A quest guided by questions with no precise answers: Who Are US? How do we find out? From March 31st to November 8th, Thollem Electric and ACVilla will be touring the lower 48 states. They kick off the tour in Albuquerque at Guild Cinema, screening the initial version of the movie which concentrates on the state of New Mexico. As the duo travels around the country, they will be recording moments and places in each state, weaving the new footage into the original version of the film. With every performance on this tour, Silver Ochre will represent a greater diversity of this crazy amazing country, eventually interweaving myriad aspects of all 48 states. Thollem's devised a unique approach to the sonic accompaniment that allows him to respond as the movie changes from one screening to the next. The score mixes influences and inspirations from the diversity of music and sound he's experienced throughout his long-time travels around this extremely varied country. Thollem and ACVilla will facilitate a Q&A/Discussion with the audience.",

            "The existence of the sublimely secretive desert opus conceived by Iggy Pop and Joshua Homme was confirmed yesterday to an unsuspecting studio and home audience of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.",
            "And now the world at large can know: March 18 will see the release of Post Pop Depression (Rekords Rekords/Loma Vista/Caroline International), the 17th Iggy Pop album, and a worthy addition to the 22 album legacy spawned with the immortal trilogy of The Stooges, Fun House and Raw Power, spanning massively influential solo outings including 1977\u2019s opening 1-2 combo of The Idiot and Lust For Life, and 1990\u2019s gold-certified Brick By Brick.",
            "The first Iggy Pop album co-created with producer/guitarist/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist/bandleader Homme, Post Pop Depression began with a succinctly worded text from Iggy to Joshua, and was realized in seclusion with Homme\u2019s enlisted aid of his Queens Of The Stone Age bandmate and Dead Weather-man Dean Fertita and Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders. Both became instantly integral in creating and shaping the Detroit meets Palm Desert by way of old Berlin vibe of Post Pop Depression: Interweaving with and augmenting even more superhuman than expected Iggy vocal performances and Homme\u2019s tapestry of guitar, bass, piano and backing vox, Fertita\u2019s talent for wringing the most out of only the most essential notes worked in seamless tandem with Helders\u2019 pushing himself and his new bandmates to unforeseeable heights and depths.",
            "The result would be a timeless work, one that sounds as if it\u2019s always been there, has existed before any of the musicians were even born-yet imbued with the ramshackle energy of a garage band that threw itself together yesterday.",
            "Post Pop Depression is now available for pre-order via iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, and the Iggy Pop webstore, with all pre-orders immediately receiving \u201cGardenia,\u201d debuted by Iggy, Joshua and crew on the Late Show. \u201cGardenia\u201d is also available on all streaming platforms.",
            "\u201cI wanted to be free,\u201d recalls Iggy of the earliest germ of the partnership with Homme that culminated inPost Pop Depression. \u201cTo be free, I needed to forget. To forget, I needed music. Josh had that in him, so I set out to provoke an encounter-first with a carefully worded text, followed by a deluge of writings all about me. No composer wants to write about nothing. He got revved up and we had a great big rumble in the desert USA.\u201d",
            "\u201cThis was to go where neither of us had gone before,\u201d adds Homme. \u201cThat was the agreement. And to go all the way.\u201d",
            "Post Pop Depression is equal parts a dream come true for co-creator Homme as it is a record that defiantly takes its place in Iggy\u2019s storied discography alongside the twin towers of The Idiot and Lust For Life-two records and the mythic Berlin era of their creation canonized as much lyrically (\u201cGerman Days\u201d) as sonically (\u201cSunday\u201c) on this new record. The album will be supported by a tour realizing Homme\u2019s ambition to assemble a live outfit worthy of both bringing the new album and doing justice to the gems and wreckage of the Ig\u2019s sprawling solo catalogue: The core band that recorded the album will be expanded by QOTSA\u2019s Troy Van Leeuwen and journeyman guitarist Matt Sweeney.",
            "Post Pop Depression is a singular work that stands proudly alongside the best works of either of its principles, from The Stooges to Queens Of The Stone Age, bearing its creators\u2019 undeniable sonic DNA while sounding like nothing they\u2019ve done before. It\u2019s a record that wouldn\u2019t exist without either Pop or Homme-and one that probably shouldn\u2019t in theory if you really think about it-but it does, and we and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll are all the better for it."

            "Crime drama flirts with the absurd in this impossibly true story of the accidental murders of two Mexican mini-luchadores in 2009. The film introduces two brothers, both little people who work as miniature mascots for their oversized luchador counterparts, and the two aging prostitutes who, when trying simply to drug and rob the men, accidentally overdose and kill them.Bleak Street offers a portrait of marginalized characters in the environment that created them, told in the masterful style of Mexican auteur Arturo Ripstein. Their collective tragedy gains depth through the context of the families, neighbors and others who exist in their shared space, the street. Shot in high-contrast, moody black and white, with its strange, Felliniesque collection of characters, the film\u2019s darkness is tempered with real beauty and humanity."

            "An under appreciated masterpiece from the era of Italian Neorealism, I Knew Her Well is a must-see for the exquisite leading performance of Stefania Sandrelli. The film is an intimate portrait of her character: a beautiful and innocent would-be starlet. From the provinces to Rome she works the D-Circuit of fame, surrounded by press-agents and pimps, washouts and cads. In this heady swirl of good and (mostly) evil, she is neither incriminated nor innocent. She is along for the ride, and deeply uncertain of her destination. Her fears are carefully restrained, never verbalized, and never glimpsed but in a fleeting hesitation or a knitting of plucked eyebrows.",
            "This angst imprisons us in a beautiful world: the exuberant glamor of Rome in the 1950s. The suits, the dresses, the effortless style. From bedroom to bedroom, party to party, Sandrelli searches for something. We follow her through absurd acting lessons, humiliating gigs and bit parts. Her hair is regularly assaulted by bizarre salon technologies. Through all this torture, she is happy to be liked, happy to make love. It\u2019s a sisyphean circling, a faux-reality of glamour and sleaze that\u2019s occasionally violated by bitter truths: death, greed, failure. And in these moments, with a rare confidence, the script falls silent, letting Sandrelli\u2019s exceptional performance illustrate the tension between this world we live in, and the one we wish for."

            "Labor is what we do by the hour but its progress sets its own pace. Work In Progress is an extreme example of this. On the surface it's a film that looks at labor: paid and unpaid, material and immaterial, examining the convergence between the worker and the consumer. But it's also an examination of production, over time. It's a film not just about labor now, but labor over the course of a lifetime. With no two screenings being the same, the project adapts and evolves to the time when it screens. The act of documenting and presenting the work itself becomes a long-term endeavor, a long term laboring. Shot over the course of a filmmaker\u2019s lifetime, through two-minute segments, the film examines the rhythms of labor and how they express themselves in the processes, facilities, and durations of the act."

She was sure she would only be able to reflect on 'the Israel question' while she was outside the country.",

Akerman spends a brief period on her own in an apartment by the sea in Tel Aviv. She takes the chamber play to its ultimate form: it is almost entirely chamber. She films from the apartment and in her narration she talks about her family, her Jewish identity and her childhood. She wonders whether normal everyday life is possible in this place and whether filming is a realistic option. Akerman does not film here with any intentions defined in advance. She wants to be as open and blank as possible to ensure that things take their own course.",

Chinese producer Song and English filmmaker Smith\u2019s first feature length documentary, provides a fascinating and troubling picture of what is becoming a mass relocation project in China. It is estimated that the government plans to relocate 250 million farmers to urban areas over the next 20 years."

            "STG Presents San Fermin at Neumos on Tuesday, March 29, 2016.",
            "Brooklyn-based San Fermin, now an eight-piece touring enterprise, did not start that way.",
            "In December of 2012, the initially makeshift project performed a single concert\u2014from sheet music\u2014and signed a record deal. Their self-titled debut was subsequently released worldwide in the fall of 2013 via Downtown Records. Following rave reviews, the band was thrust into the spotlight, performing sold out shows and festivals across the world and opening for the likes of the National, St. Vincent, Arctic Monkeys, and The Head and the Heart. \u201cSuddenly, we were not in a vacuum. We were in the thick of it, which was thrilling but also terrifying,\u201d bandleader Ellis Ludwig-Leone says. \u201cThere were all these new possibilities and gray areas. It was a shock to the system\u2014out in the world, barely at home, constantly in a state of semi-crisis.\u201d",
            "Many of the songs on Jackrabbit, San Fermin\u2019s second album, existed only on Ludwig-Leone\u2019s laptop for the better part of a year, as he toured and turned the band into an ensemble operation. When at last he revisited them, he knew that they had to be reborn.",
            "\u201cThe first record was written in a very pre-composed way, recorded when I didn\u2019t think this would be a band. So I went from being this isolated composer guy to sitting in the back of a crowded van with seven other band members playing shows in rock clubs every night,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I got back, I ripped these holes in the middle of the existing songs and added some new ones. I rethought everything I had been writing.\u201d",
            "Recorded piecemeal in many sessions under Ludwig-Leone\u2019s watchful eye, Jackrabbit bears the scars of experience admirably. If San Fermin could seem prepared and guarded to the point of being polite, Jackrabbit lines that record\u2019s complicated compositional maneuvers and grandiose pop eruptions with necessary aggression. It is urgent and in your face, like a band sweating and singing in a cramped venue. It is emotionally complicated, too, like a group of strangers who have suddenly had their lives interrupted and linked by unexpected circumstances.",
            "Fittingly, Jackrabbit is filled with moments in which each member of the band is prominently featured: John Brandon (trumpet), Stephen Chen (saxophone), Rebekah Durham (violin/vocals), Michael Hanf (drums), Charlene Kaye (lead vocals), Tyler McDiarmid (guitar), and Allen Tate (lead vocals). The two discrete characters born by the debut album have been replaced by multiple personalities, treading new and difficult terrain.",
            "This evolution is at the heart of Jackrabbit, a powerful record where moments beautiful, brutal and a bit of both produce songs that don\u2019t know how to let you out of their clutches or console you with easy answers. At once lived-in and sophisticated, Jackrabbit feels a lot like real life\u2014charmed, challenging, and wonderfully compulsory.",
            "Downtown Records will issue Jackrabbit on CD, LP and digitally in North America April 21, 2015. It will arrive in Europe April 27, 2015 via Sony RED."

I need doors. Otherwise, I can't work\", she says). But by shooting her in profile, the filmmakers provide a contrast to the signature frontality of her compositions (one of the many subjects covered in the wide-ranging interview) - an acknowledgement of this portrait's contingency also underlined by the title.",
            "Akerman describes her first experiences with avant-garde film in New York, and, in particular, the lessons she took from the work of Michael Snow. She answers questions about her approach to fiction, documentary, and literary adaptation, covering everything from the early short LA CHAMBRE (1972) to the recent feature L\u00c0-BAS (2006). She explains her preference for small budgets and small crews, and the paramount importance of instinct and improvisation in her directorial process.",
            "She is nothing if not forthcoming, candidly assessing her successes and failures, including an aborted attempt at writing at Hollywood screenplay. An image emerges of a filmmaker as assured and idiosyncratic as the work suggests. We see that behind Akerman's cinematic innovations there is not only a remarkable intellectual clarity, but an ethical commitment to making films in which the viewer can \"feel the time passing-by in your own body\", because, she says, \"that is the only thing you have: time.\"",

The new album builds on POLI\u00c7A\u2019s signature synthesizer and percussion-heavy sounds with more complex arrangements and a bigger, crisper hi-fi punch due to the new approach they took to writing and recording: together, all in the same room.  There's a tighter groove to these songs and a more vulnerable quality to them, especially in Leaneagh's singing. Her incredible vocal range is consistently on display throughout, beautifully raw and less electronically effected than on previous recordings.",

            "(Wim Wenders, Germany/France/Australia, 1991, DCP, 295 min)",
            "Until the End of the World is \u201cthe ultimate road movie,\u201d a journey around the globe, a modern-day odyssey\u2014and it certainly bears similarities to Homer\u2019s saga. However, the aim of this journey is the spiritual reconciliation between an obsessed father and his lost son, and, in Until the End of the World, Penelope decides to set out in pursuit of Odysseus. In order to enable his blind wife (Jeanne Moreau) to see, Dr. Farber (Max von Sydow) invents a process that makes it possible to transmit the images recorded in the brains of sighted people directly into the visual systems of blind people. Farber\u2019s son Sam (William Hurt) sets out on a journey around the world in order to \u201csee\u201d and record the various stations of his mother\u2019s life for her. The Frenchwoman Claire (Solveig Dommartin) falls in love with him and sets out in pursuit of him. She, in turn, is followed by the author Eugene (Sam Neill), who is recording her adventure. The film was shot in 1990 and takes place in the near future, around the turn of the millennium. What most interests Wenders here is how humanity learns to deal with images\u2014or becomes their victim. Eugene notes: \u201cIn the beginning was the word. What would happen if only the image remained in the end!?\u201d Frustrated with the Reader\u2019s Digest version of his film, which was forced upon him by his distributors, Wenders created a director\u2019s cut two years after its release: at a length of almost four hours, it lives up to his intentions and to the epic nature of the story."

            "You think you know someone, and then you realize that there\u2019s more than meets the eye.",
            "Grammy Award winning artist Warren Haynes has been recognized as a cornerstone of the American music landscape and revered as one of the finest guitar players in the world. Throughout his prolific career as part of three of the greatest live groups in rock history \u2013 Allman Brothers Band, Gov\u2019t Mule and the Dead \u2013 his virtuosic artistry has led to thousands of unforgettable performances and millions of album and track sales. Despite all of the ground that Haynes has covered on his musical journey, the impressive thing is that he still has many miles to explore. On his newest solo album Ashes and Dust, he puts forth one of his most gorgeous, musically rich and personal albums to date. It is endlessly exciting to see one of the most brilliant minds in modern music shine an entirely new light on the depths of his creativity.",
            "Ashes and Dust, only the third studio album Haynes has ever released under his own name, is a masterful work of art and a particularly important statement for Haynes. The songs are immediately and clearly different from his usual style \u2013 encompassing beautiful acoustic arrangements, a rootsy/Americana soundscape and honeyed vocals that cut straight through to the soul. Although many of these songs are brand new, some of the tunes that make up this album have been dear to Warren for years. In some cases he has been carrying them around for 20 or 30 years, waiting for the right time to record them.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing songs all my life from a more folky, singer-songwriter, even Celtic direction,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been compiling songs that didn\u2019t necessarily fit in with Gov\u2019t Mule or the Allman Brothers or even my last solo album. So this record was really a chance to bring a lot of that music to fruition. It\u2019s really given me the opportunity to take a lot of songs I love, that didn\u2019t have a home, and build a home for them.\u201d",
            "Given his life-long commitment to experimentation and eclecticism, though, it should come as no surprise that the album reveals yet another new side of his musical personality. Knowing that he wanted to pursue a more folk-based approach on this project, he brought in the New Jersey-based Americana band Railroad Earth as collaborators.",
            "\u201cI have a cool chemistry with those guys\u2014they add their own personality to the songs, but they\u2019re really great at interpreting, as well,\u201d says Haynes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other casually for several years, and then at Del-Fest a few years ago, we winged a few songs together and it went really well. A little later, when I was opening the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, they joined me for part of the set. We did that with a little more rehearsal, more preparation, and it was a great experience. At that point, I started thinking that maybe I should make my next record with these guys.\u201d",
            "Even with a clear sense of his goals for the album, Haynes and Railroad Earth still needed to explore various avenues and possibilities. They recorded more than 30 songs, often trying entirely different arrangements for each take or even recording late at night and not listening to playbacks until they reconvened the next day.",
            "Fans of jam-band powerhouse Gov\u2019t Mule or the most recent soul-charged incarnation of the Warren Haynes Band\u2014or listeners who know Haynes through his 25-year affiliation with the Allman Brothers Band or his work with various extensions of the Grateful Dead family\u2014may be surprised to hear him working in a more song-based context. Several of the tracks on Ashes and Dust, like \u201cCompany Man\u201d and \u201cCoal Tattoo,\u201d are links to the folk tradition of narrative writing.",
            "\u201cI love story songs,\u201d Haynes says. \u201cI was very influenced by the whole concept of writing songs that tell a story. When I first got bitten by the singer- songwriter bug, when I was 14, it was due to those people who transported you to another place and another time with their songs.\u201d",
            "Which is not to say that Ashes and Dust leaves his instrumental adventures behind; several songs such as \u201cBlue Maiden\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cStranded in Self-Pity\u201d open out into more extended musical journeys. \u201cIn the studio, you\u2019re always looking for the balance between structure and focus and improvisation, opening up the music to chance\u201d says Haynes. \u201cBut too much of either can keep the music from being as rewarding or as effective as it can be. Luckily my audience loves things to be stretched out. They love to hear the performance aspect. It was nice to take a few dirt roads, musically speaking, and go to some places none of us were expecting.\u201d",
            "Haynes shares that this album also brought out some new dimensions for him as a guitarist. \u201cMy playing here is quite different from what I\u2019ve done in recent projects. It\u2019s showcasing a side of my musicality that\u2019s unlike, in some cases, anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says, noting that he played a hollow-body D\u2019Angelico instrument (\u201ckind of a jazz guitar\u201d) for many of the sessions. \u201cI like to adapt to my surroundings\u2014to the music itself and to the musicians, trying to choose a musical voice that fits into the overall picture a certain way. I played a lot more slide guitar than I\u2019ve played in a long time and a lot of acoustic guitar, things that were more directed to weaving themselves into the fabric of this music.\u201d",
            "One of the songs, \u201cSpots of Time\u201d (the lyrics of which include the phrase that gives the album its title), may be familiar to ardent Haynes-watchers. The song was written by Haynes and Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers have been playing it on stage in recent years. He had hoped that the song would be included if the Allmans made another studio album, but after the legendary band retired in 2014, he decided to record it himself\u2014but not before inviting Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and percussionist Marc Quinones to join him in the studio.",
            "On \u201cGold Dust Woman,\u201d Grace Potter adds her unique vocal timbre. Sparking a fast friendship and instant chemistry several years ago, Haynes and Potter have performed this song together many times on stage and this endeavor seemed like the perfect opportunity to document it in the studio. That chemistry, along with Railroad Earth\u2019s unique instrumental interpretation, plays out here in fine form on the sole duet on the album.",
            "The presence of these world-class musicians and artists, along with that of Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin and famed harmonica player Mickey Raphael (who each make an appearance here on \u201cWanderlust\u201d) is yet another reason why Ashes and Dust stands as such a personal, ambitious document of Warren Haynes\u2019 history. With songs that reach back to his initial fascination with music and others that go right up to the present day, it\u2019s a look behind his first-rate playing and into his enduring creative spirit.",
            "\u201cThese songs were each very important to me when they were written, especially since some of them go so far back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all visual memories and experiences of certain time periods that I tried to capture in song. They really represent a collection of memories in my life.\u201d"

Since then, the four artists studios and the new Fogo Island Inn have been documented in more than 80 international magazines and blogs ranging from the New York Times Magazine, to fashion arbiter Wallpaper to architectural magazines such as Domus.",
            "The striking buildings are located in an equally dramatic natural setting that is the rugged sub-arctic landscape of Fogo Island, a small, remote rocky outcrop off the coast of Newfoundland. The combination of sophisticated design and wilderness backdrop establishes a contemporary frame on an ancient landscape; one that embraces the excitement of living on the edge both in relation to nature and to modern design. The combination has been alluring to a large global audience of design aficionados and has elevated Saunders\u2019 already rising star even higher.",
            "Gorgeously photographed over all four seasons the film is a flowing, visual narrative that unfolds over time as the Fogo Island Inn is being constructed. Zita Cobb\u2019s belief in the tension of opposites as a positive force in human experience is reflected in the film. The Inn is totally modern yet filled with textures inherited from the past. The idea of moving forward while reaching back is tangible in the juxtaposition of old and new architecture. Extensive interviews with Todd Saunders and Zita Cobb provide intimate insight into the personalities and motivations behind the creation of adventurous contemporary architecture. A cast of local residents provides the real-world context in which the buildings exist. This is a portrait of a little island that wants to be relevant in a big and current way."

            "Lusciously shot and scripted,My Golden Daysis a quintessential coming-of-age portrait. Returning home to Paris after many years away, scholar and anthropologist Paul Dedalus recalls three pivotal moments from his childhood in France. Told in flashback, the episodes move from heartbreaking to exhilarating and back again. An abusive, suicidal mother, a secret humanitarian mission to Russia, the sublimity of young love and the wrenching pain of loss make up the memories recounted by the now middle aged Dedalus. Desplechin infuses his film with characteristic warmth and a reverence for the blinding emotions of youth. His characters are at once wise and foolish, determined and lost. Starring Mathieu Amalric as the adult Dedalus,My Golden Daysis a look at the singular experience of the young, and the wounds we suffer that never fully heal."

            "Spanish filmmaker David Domingo began making Super 8 films when he was twenty years old, and specializes in super 8mm and 16mm film. Northwest Film Forum is one of five film institutions across the U.S. to host Domingo on a tour that includes Los Angeles Film Forum, San Francisco Cinematheque, Cinema Project (Portland, Oregon), and Anthology Film Archive in New York. Also known as Stanley Sunday, Domingo\u2019s textured and dense collage films combine found footage, grandiose movie soundtracks, distorted classical compositions, a wide range of world music, quite a few felines, VHS sampling of pop cultural debris, double exposure, stop motion animation, and references to the history of experimental film (think Bruce Conner and the Kuchar brothers) to profoundly humorously surreal and provocatively psychedelic effects.Read an interview with David DomingohereFilm Program, selected by David Domingo:S\u00faper 8 (Super 8)(1996, 7' 44'', color, sound)La mansi\u00f3n acelerada (The Speedy Mansion)(1997, 10', b&w, sound)Desayunos y meriendas (Breakfast and Snacks)(2002, 7', color, sound)Rayos y centellas (What the\u2026!)(2004, 3' 52'', color, sound)Pel\u00edcula sudorosa (Sweaty Movie)(2009, 18\u2019, color/b&w, sound)A Movie that Portrays the Wonders of the World as Seen Through the Eyes of a Cat (Disney Attraction Highlights N\u00ba 1)(2009, 5\u2019, color/b&w, sound)",
            "About David Domingo",
            "David Domingo, also known asStanley Sundayor Davidson, was born in Valencia in 1973 and currently lives in Barcelona. Thanks to some 20 shorts, three features (including his personal vision of Disney\u2019s Bambi and The Exorcist turned into a musical), numerous video clips for musicians on the spanish independent scene (Fangoria, Hidrogenesse, Doble Pletina, Javiera Mena), wild live performances during screenings of his Super 8 and 16 mm films, and his mythical five-yearly fanzine \u201cUn d\u00eda en la vida de Jonas Mekas\u201d, he has become an outstanding figure in Spanish underground film.",
            "He started out using a camera and a VHS player to create a series of remakes, found footage films and stories filmed at home, featuring his sister and their grandmother, but soon switched to Super 8, the format that has produced most of his filmography.",
            "In his films, Stanley Sunday gives free rein to his vivid imagination and expresses his fantastic personal universe in a delirious, iconoclastic stream of associations, using his particular imagery especially based on artefacts and icons of popular culture (trading card albums, commercials, Lladr\u00f3 figures, cassettes, scalextric \u2026), but also homoerotic imagery and a series of recurrent motives of clear sexual symbolism, like the phallic Frankfurt sausage that has become a kind of logo.",
            "Combining images borrowed from classics or B movies with his own, and abstract moments with scenes featuring his favourite actors, David Domingo blows hierarchies and causal logic sky high to generate a stream of images of surprising, enigmatic associations that denote a comprehensive knowledge of the tradition of avant-garde and experimental film (Bruce Conner, Andy Warhol, Iv\u00e1n Zulueta, Kenneth Anger and the Kuchar brothers), to whom his work makes many references.",
            "After a series of incursions into 16 mm, more recently David Domingo has thrown himself into tutorials of the most diverse digital programmes, allowing him to conquer new textures, effects and possibilities of layer upon layer and people his videos with 3D beings, then drawing back to his domestic realm.",
            "As well as making their way round the underground circuit, his films have been shown at some of the foremost museums, arts centres and festivals in Spain, such as Xc\u00e8ntric (CCCB) and Centre d\u2019Art Santa Monica in Barcelona, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, the Centro de Arte Dos de Mayo and La Casa Encendida in Madrid, the Centro Galego de Artes da Imaxe and the S(8) Peripheral Film Festival in Coru\u00f1a, the Sitges Film Festival and Cinema Jove de Valencia.",
            "His first short, S\u00faper 8 (1996), was chosen to form part of the travelling cycle \u201cFrom Ecstasy to Rapture. 50 Years of Alternative Spanish Film\u201d, organized by the Centre de Cultura Contempor\u00e0nia de Barcelona, and was shown at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (Melbourne), Anthology Film Archives (New York), the National Gallery of Art (Washington DC), Tiff Cinematheque (Toronto), Pacific Cinematheque (Vancouver), the National Film Archive in Prague, the Jeu de Paume (Paris) and the Tate Modern (London), to name just a few venues. It now forms part of the Xc\u00e8ntric Archive collection.",

They called their festival simply \u201cFukushima!\u201d without any qualifying slogans or descriptions, aiming to counter the negative associations the name had taken on in the wake of the nuclear accident. Though little-known outside Japan until now, the festival\u00a0was a success: 13,000 people were in attendance and an additional 25,000 viewed streaming coverage of the festival online.",
            "Featuring music and poetry by Otomo Yoshihide, Michiro Endo, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Ryoichi Wago and others, this 2012 documentary film matter-of-factly follows their preparations leading up to the festival as well as the day of the festival itself and a few months afterwards. Three years on from the earthquake and tsunami, the film serves as a reminder of the new reality that faces Fukushima residents following the nuclear accident. With an artistic documentary approach, the film reveals more universal themes as well in chronicling the group of artists' highly unique response to the disaster.",
            "Theirs was not a typical festival since the organizers had to address questions such as: Would it be ethical to bring people to Fukushima? What about children? And what would it mean to the people of Fukushima if the festival had to be called off after all due to radiation concerns? Throughout the movie we see how the lives of people in Fukushima have changed and what the future might look like for the next few generations. In their organization and hosting of the festival we see reflected the new realities of daily life in Fukushima as well as a humble but strong dedication to building a brighter future. The film chronicles their efforts with artful simplicity to deliver an important lesson for all of us."
