            "A blisteringly funny cavalcade of rage, self-doubt, lust, frustrated masculinity, and other brotherly-hand-me-downs,The Mendis an impressive debut comedy about the frenetic fraternal discord between brothers Mat (Josh Lucas) and Alan (Stephen Plunkett). When his relationship suddenly flames out, an unhinged Mat plunks down on Alan\u2019s couch just as Alan prepares for a carefully planned getaway with his girlfriend (Mickey Sumner). Soon, a despondent Alan returns by his lonesome, and the brothers barrel through a downward spiral of muted madness and harbored aggression. Deliriously battling against electricity outages, broken bathroom doors, bed bug threats, and an annoyingly evasive ice cream truck, the brothers wrestle with each others\u2019 existence and their own demons.",
            "The Mendis a visceral, witty comedy that brings to mind the chaotic exuberance ofWithnail & I, rapturously shot by Chris Teague (Obvious Child, Appropriate Behavior) with a nearly constantly moving camera evocative of the classic composition of George Cukor and John Ford.",

It is likely moss or some sort of botanical organism, but there is an outside chance that my darkest childhood fears are true and it is actually the Predator\u2019s blood.",
            "The moviePredatorhas always had a special place in my heart. It is my earliest recollection of irrational fear. The titular, multi-mandibled monster was largely responsible for my inability to get a wink of sleep on family camping trips. Between him, the gray men and Sasquatch my juvenile monkey-mind raced with fantastical scenarios that always began with the canvas of my tent slowly tearing open. He even had me in his triad of red dots when at friends\u2019 houses for sleepovers. His clicky vocalizations echoed in the distance as I called my mom \u201cCan you come get me? I don\u2019t feel well.\u201d Lies.",
            "As I have gotten older the terror has subsided a bit and made way for fanatical awe. As a fan of Sci-fi, Horror and Action I can think of very few movies that hit the mark as well asPredator. Aside fromAlien, I don\u2019t think there are any worthy contenders. So when I was presented with the opportunity to build a new score for 1987\u2019s best movie I was beyond elated.",
            "My plan of attack in regards to updating the score will be cemented in respect. I have no intention of, nor do I think I can outdo the original. Instead my hope is to maintain the sonic aesthetic of my previous work while inducing some of the emotions that the movie has given and continues to give me after all these years.",

            "Recess Monkey, Seattle's nationally acclaimed trio of teachers/kindie rock stars, embarked on an ambitious adventure this year with their album \"Hot Air.\" In addition to a full-length CD of songs, they also filmed and animated an epic, 35-minute airborne story about Andrew's unlikely entry into the Windybrook Air Race with his homespun balloon. Northwest Film Forum is proud to theatrically premiere the entire \"Hot Air\" film, its first time seen in its entirety on any large screen. What's \u00a0more, Recess Monkey will play an intimate, high-energy warm-up dance party before the screening and sign copies of the CD/DVD collection after the show. Fun for the whole family!",

            "(Jem Cohen, United States, 2015, DCP, 111 min)",
            "Jem Cohen\u2019s prodigious filmography of 70 films only grows stronger with his latest creation:Counting. In the style of his previous works, this film lives at the edge of the art form. The edits are instinctive, the juxtapositions of subject matter, abstract. The imagery alternates between careful composition and impressionistic snapshots. Train windows, steamed over. Construction workers silhouetted against the sun. Thorny bushes straining to escape an empty lot in New York. Cohen travelled the world for footage, capturing Moscow, Istanbul, Porto, St. Petersburg, before returning to his home in New York. Filming without a crew, Cohen turned his unique eye for the everyday upon the great cities of the world, and their occupants.",
            "The film that resulted is a stream of lyrical abstractions, toying with the visual and aural music of everyday life that we city dwellers have been deafened to.",
            "Countingalso pays sincere tribute to Chris Marker, a close friend of Cohen\u2019s. While indisputably Cohen\u2019s own film, it stands as a tribute to their friendship, and Marker\u2019s influence on the essay film format.",
            "Counting, like all Cohen\u2019s work, glows with bruised lyricism. -The Guardian",
            "This is the kind of contemplative cinematheque piece that washes pleasurably over you -The Hollywood Reporter"
